feat: Implement advanced light controls and delete functionality

- Adds the ability to delete lights from the control panel.
- Implements advanced light properties in the store and UI:
  - `distance` and `decay` for PointLight and SpotLight.
- Implements a manipulable target for SpotLight and DirectionalLight:
  - A visual target (pink sphere) appears for selected lights.
  - The target can be moved with TransformControls to aim the light.
  - The light's visual model (cone, arrow) now correctly orients itself to point at the target using `lookAt`.
- Updates the PRD to reflect these new features.
