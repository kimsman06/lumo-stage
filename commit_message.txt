feat: Implement intuitive lighting controls

- Implements a mode switcher ('translate'/'rotate') for TransformControls.
- Fixes the orientation of SpotLight and DirectionalLight visual models to correctly point at their targets.
- Implements rotation via the gizmo for SpotLight and DirectionalLight, which now intuitively updates the light's target position for aiming.
- Rotation control is now smoother and more predictable, using `onObjectChange` and a stable distance calculation.
