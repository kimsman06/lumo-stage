fix: Resolve light control panel not updating scene

- Fixed a bug where manipulating light properties (color, intensity, position) via the control panel did not visually update the 3D scene.
- The issue was traced to a `TypeError` related to `SpotLight`'s target property not being correctly linked to a stable `THREE.Object3D` instance within the scene graph, causing the rendering pipeline to break.
- Implemented a fix by ensuring `SpotLight` and `DirectionalLight` targets are linked to stable `THREE.Object3D` instances created with `useRef` and rendered as primitives within the Canvas.
- Removed all debugging `console.log` statements.
